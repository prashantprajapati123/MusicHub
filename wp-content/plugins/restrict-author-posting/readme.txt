This plugin allow you to restrict the category that your site contributors or an author can post to.

== Description ==

My plugin will help you to add restriction category to User profile, so the author or editor can post in just specific categories.
<br>
<br>
* New Update: If user is restricted to a category, the first one in the list will be chosen as a default for that user if he didn’t chose the category he wants to publish in ( thanks to [ash](http://dvvlc.com/) for this bug ). AND delete Category no longer show an error in User's Profile !
<br>
<br>
* New Update: Include a new function to restrict author using media file ( image/video ), just a checkbox in User Profile, you can restrict Author using all media file or just his/her own file !
<br>
<br>
Just a small code, and run in Admin Screen so it'll never slow down your website !
<br>
<br>
